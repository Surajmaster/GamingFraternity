# GamingFraternity
It is just a sample of Game Blog made using HTML CSS and BootStrap.


This is ongoing project which requires both front and back end. At present it has only 4 to 5 pages but will increased the pages upto 10-12 pages.
It is a responsive website which will be helpful for both android and iphone users as well.

I am working on this project with my one friend who is going to write the blog ....My work is to create a website and in the future we will add the back end
using Django.
